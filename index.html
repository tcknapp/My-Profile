      <p>Hey there, Thanks for checking out my Profile!</p>
      <p>I am currently a student in the UC Davis Coding Bootcamp. Through this program, I am learning the MERN stack. I am currently unsure which direction I would like to go career-wise as we are learning so much.</p>
      <p>I graduated from Cal State University, Northridge with a Bachelors degree in Communication Studies (May 2014). I have worked in various service industries, such as restraunts, breweries, and wineries.</p>
      <p>I joined this program to go into a completely different field. I have always been intrigued with technology and how it ticks. This directed me towards the Coding Bootcamp.</p>
